### Unsolved Problems/Major Hurdles I had to overcome
As far as I'm aware there are no unsolved problems. However there were many major hurdles, mainly with CSS. Embarrassingly I didn't realize my HTML and CSS weren't properly connected for a while, so I tried everything to make the changes I wanted appear on the page. Afterwards, once I realized the disconnect, and all my changes went through, I actually because much more comfortable with CSS.
